# TrustTrip

**A transparent bus ticket refund system built with Next.js**

## 🚌 Project Overview

**TrustTrip** is a web-based transparency system designed to address the lack of clarity in intercity bus ticket cancellation and refund processes. The platform provides passengers with clear, explainable refund calculations, eliminating confusion and building trust through transparency.

### Problem Statement
Currently, passengers often don't understand:
- How refund amounts are calculated
- Why certain deductions occur
- What factors influence their refund

TrustTrip solves this by implementing a **rule-based refund system** that clearly shows the *how* and *why* behind every refund calculation.

## 🔐 Environment Variables Configuration

### Setup

1. **Copy the example file**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```

2. **Configure your variables**
   Edit `.env.local` with your actual values. Never commit this file.

### Variable Types

#### Server-Side Variables (Keep Secret)
These variables are only accessible on the server and should never be exposed to the client:

- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string
- `API_SECRET_KEY` - Secret key for API authentication
- `JWT_SECRET` - Secret for JWT token signing
- `SMTP_*` - Email service configuration
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` - AWS secret credentials

#### Client-Side Variables (Safe to Expose)
These variables use the `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix and are safe to expose to the browser:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` - Application base URL
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` - API endpoint base URL
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` - Google Maps public key
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` - Stripe public key

### Security Best Practices

⚠️ **Important Security Notes:**

1. **Never commit `.env.local`** - It contains secrets
2. **Use `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix** - Only for client-safe variables
3. **Validate environment variables** - Check required vars at startup
4. **Use different keys per environment** - Dev, staging, production
5. **Rotate secrets regularly** - Especially in production

### Common Pitfalls Avoided

- ❌ **Secret Exposure**: Server-only variables don't use `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix
- ❌ **Missing Prefixes**: Client variables always use `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix
- ❌ **Build vs Runtime**: Environment variables are properly configured for both
- ❌ **Accidental Commits**: `.env.local` is ignored by git

### Environment-Specific Configuration

```bash
# Development
NODE_ENV="development"
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENVIRONMENT="development"

# Production
NODE_ENV="production"
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENVIRONMENT="production"
```

## 📊 Refund Calculation Logic

The refund system considers multiple factors:

1. **Time-based deductions**
   - 24+ hours before departure: 5% deduction
   - 12-24 hours: 15% deduction
   - 6-12 hours: 25% deduction
   - Less than 6 hours: 50% deduction

2. **Ticket type modifiers**
   - Standard tickets: Base calculation
   - Premium tickets: Reduced deduction rates
   - Promotional tickets: Higher deduction rates

3. **Additional factors**
   - Processing fees
   - Route-specific policies
   - Seasonal adjustments
